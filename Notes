Certified programming with dependent types


Questions:

  - Dependent types?
  - Certifying program? (for batch mode softwares like compilers, where each run of the program outputs both an answer and a proof that the answer is correct)
  - certifying program + proof checker = certified program
  - HOL logic
  - first order language
  - programs inside of types??
  - monomorphic lambda calculus
  - de bruijn criterion
  - proof terms (in small kernel languages)
  - kernel proof language
